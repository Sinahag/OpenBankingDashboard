# Open Banking Dashboard - Storm Hacks

Stonks is seeking to create clarity in millenials finances across their entire financial history. Permitting individuals to access their entire financial record across different financial institutions and even countries!

# Motivation and Goal

The goal of this program is to allow lenders and financial corporations to make more informed decisions on what financial services to provide and determine what individuals are qualified for. With the wealth of data provided with open banking, as well as powerful data processing/insight deriving techniques, our program will bring an end to the strenuous loan approval process. Stonks is hoping to contribute to the progression of the financial sector with the help of data analytics and clutter-free software.
